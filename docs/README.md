The B2B Suite is a collection of apps that add various B2B functionalities to your VTEX IO store. By installing this app, the following dependency apps are automatically installed:

## B2B Organizations

An app that allows B2B storefront users to be grouped into buyer organizations and further subdivided into cost centers. Price tables, product collections, and payment methods can then be assigned to an organization so that they are shared by all of its users.

[Further Documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-b2b-organizations)

## Storefront Permissions

An app that enables B2B roles to be assigned to users, permissions to be configured for those roles, and those permissions to be checked by other apps.

[Further Documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-storefront-permissions)

## B2B Checkout Settings

An app that modifies your store's checkout to check the user's permissions as well as show shipping addresses and payment methods appropriate to the user's organization.

[Further Documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-b2b-checkout-settings)

## B2B Orders History

An app that provides a new order history page under My Account so that B2B users can view all prior orders placed by their organization or cost center (depending on role).

‚ö†Ô∏è After installing the B2B Suite, make sure to hide the default Order History link within My Account by configuring `vtex.my-account`. This can be done at this URL: `https://{{accountName}}.myvtex.com/admin/apps/vtex.my-account@1.x/setup/`
